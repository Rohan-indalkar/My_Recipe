    <pre><i>Ingredients:

        1 cup Urad Dal (split black gram)
        2 cups Rice (preferably idli rice or short-grain rice)
        1/4 tsp Fenugreek Seeds (optional)
        Salt to taste
        Water as needed
        Instructions:
        
        Soak the Ingredients:
        
        Wash and soak the urad dal and fenugreek seeds together in water for 6-8 hours or overnight.
        Wash and soak the rice in a separate bowl for 6-8 hours or overnight.
        Grinding:
        
        After soaking, drain the dal and rice. First, grind the urad dal and fenugreek seeds into a smooth batter using a little water, until itâ€™s fluffy and light.
        Next, grind the rice into a coarse batter, adding water as needed. The rice should retain some texture.
        Fermenting the Batter:
        
        Mix the rice and urad dal batters in a large bowl, add salt, and stir well to combine.
        Cover the bowl and allow the batter to ferment for about 12-24 hours (depending on the temperature of your kitchen). The batter should rise and become slightly bubbly.
        Steaming the Idlis:
        
        Grease the idli molds with a little oil.
        Pour the fermented batter into the idli molds, filling each mold about three-quarters full.
        Steam the idlis in a steamer or pressure cooker for about 10-15 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean.
        Serving:
        
        Let the idlis cool slightly before removing them from the molds.
        Serve hot with coconut chutney, sambar, or tomato chutney.</i></pre>
