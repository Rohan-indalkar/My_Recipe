    <pre><i>Ingredients:

        1 cup Rice (preferably short-grain rice or idli rice)
        1/4 cup Urad Dal (split black gram)
        1/4 tsp Fenugreek Seeds (optional, helps with fermentation)
        Salt to taste
        Water as needed
        Oil or ghee (clarified butter) for cooking
        Instructions:
        
        Soak the Ingredients:
        
        Wash and soak the rice and fenugreek seeds together in water for about 6-8 hours or overnight.
        Wash and soak the urad dal in a separate bowl for about 6-8 hours or overnight.
        Grinding:
        
        Drain the soaked rice and dal. First, grind the urad dal with a little water into a smooth, fluffy batter.
        Next, grind the rice with enough water to form a slightly coarse batter. The rice should still have some texture, unlike the smooth urad dal batter.
        Fermenting the Batter:
        
        Mix the ground rice and dal together in a large bowl. Add salt and stir well.
        Cover the bowl and allow the batter to ferment for about 12-24 hours. The batter should rise and become bubbly after fermentation.
        Making the Dosa:
        
        Heat a flat griddle or tawa on medium-high heat.
        Once hot, lightly grease it with a little oil or ghee using a paper towel.
        Pour a ladleful of dosa batter onto the center of the tawa. Quickly spread it out in a circular motion to form a thin, even layer.
        Drizzle a little oil or ghee around the edges of the dosa.
        Cook until the edges turn crispy and golden brown. You can flip the dosa if you prefer a softer texture, or you can serve it as is for a crispier dosa.
        Once cooked, remove the dosa from the tawa.
        Serving:
        
        Serve the dosa hot with coconut chutney, sambar, or tomato chutney.</i>
